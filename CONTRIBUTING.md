Thanks for taking the time to look at `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

All contributions to this project should follow the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

### Reporting issues and providing feedback

If you found any issues or bugs, be sure to open up an issue so someone can
check it out!


### Opening a pull request

Once you've worked on your feature/bugfix etc, you can open a pull request using
the `main` branch as the base branch. Write a clear and concise PR title, and a
detailed description of why you made the change, whether it is related to any
issues etc. And I will review it as soon as I can.

### Setting up development environment

This project is written in Python, requires **Python 3.6 or higher**, and uses
`pip` with `setup.py`.

To set it up, just [fork](https://github.com/hedyhli/starcli/fork) + clone it,
create a [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) and
install all the dependencies:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
```

The command will install all the requirements needed to run starcli, as well as
dev-dependencies like [black](https://github.com/psf/black),
[pylint](https://www.pylint.org/),
[codespell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell) and
[pytest](https://pytest.org).

> Remember to use the `python3` and `pip3` commands instead of `python` and
> `pip` if your system also has Python 2 installed.

Alternatively, if you're going to use `pipenv`, you will need to use the `--pre`
flag when installing in order for `black` to work:

```bash
$ pipenv install -r requirements_dev.txt --pre
```

Check if the setup worked by running starcli from your local folder.

```bash
$ python -m starcli --help
```

If the above command displayed the help and usage, you are good to go üëç you can
also test all the other features like list and table output, debug, etc.

**Setup gitguard**
```
$ cd .gitguard; ./gitguard.py
```

GitGuard can assist you by ensuring your commits adhere to conventional commit standards. If your commit message doesn't follow these conventions, GitGuard will alert you by throwing an error. This feature helps you maintain a consistent and readable commit history by guiding you in formatting your commit messages correctly.

**Running tests**
```bash
python -m pytest
```

or, for authenticated requests:

```bash
python -m pytest --auth username:token
```

Where **username** is your GitHub username and **token** is a
[personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).
Authenticating your request will allow you to test authentication features and
use a higher rate limit with the GitHub API. *This token does not need any permissions!*

Note that if the the value passed to `--auth` is invalid, some tests will fail.
So check with `starcli --auth` if some tests are mysteriously failing when using
`--auth`.

**Linting checks**

```bash
pylint *.py
```

**Formatting & code spell**
```bash
black . && codespell --skip=".git,.gitguard/,*.json,demo-pics/,venv/"
```
